I'm currently home for labor day weekend, so I've added Disqus comments to all of the blog posts.

While I'm home I'm going to try and get some work done on my [alchemy-game](https://github.com/spencer-melnick/alchemy-game) project, but I may run into some issues because I have classwork to finish, and I forgot to commit my latest changes at my main workstation (oops).
