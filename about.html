<p>I am a first-year engineering student at Temple University, as well as an avid hobbyist programmer.
  Currently, I am a member of TUdev, Temple Robotics, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</p>
<p>The programming language with which I am most familiar is C++, however I am able to work with other object-oriented languages and C-like languages.</p>
<p>One of my longtime interests is video gaming, and some of my projects on GitHub are video game-related, as well
as the practice applications game development presents for programming.</p>
